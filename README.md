## High level overview of registered user roles and permissions within WMP:

* **Superuser (Admin)** - has full CRUD (create, read (view), update, delete) from the admin panel (and read-only from the website), across all pages.

* **Unregistered User** - will have 
* **Store Owner** -

* **Contact Us**: dropdown reveals:  'Contact Details'.<br>
* **My Account**: dropdown reveals:  'Add a Product'; 'My Profile'; 'Logout'.<br>
The page 'Add a Product' is permissions based and only appears if the user is 'admin'.<br>
The page 'My Profile' only appears if the user is registered. <br>

## Site Map


## Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)
###  Keywords
As Summit Bike Co. specialises in selling only mountain bikes, keywords were selected with this in mind.<br>
Placement of these keywords within the website has been implemented where possible using semantic HTML elements 
(i.e. headings) and one utilising an anchor tag.<br>
Research (using Wordtracker.com) into short-tail and long-tail keywords suitable for Summit Bike Co. yielded
the following:<br>

#### Shortail keywords
The following **product based keyword** enquiry showed a very high volume and high level of organic competition.
* mountain bikes
Represented in multiple places throughout the website <br>

#### Longtail Keywords
The following **product based keyword** enquiries showed a mid-range volume of searches, and a mid-range level of
organic competition:<br>
* full suspension mountain bikes
* hardtail mountain bikes
These are both represented in:<br>
The individual 'Bike Model [name]...' pages:<br>
* A <h2> on each individual bike_detail page (i.e. name of bike) along with a reference in the relevant
individual bike's product 'description' section
* as a dropdown option ('By Type') under the 'All Mountain Bikes' menu option
* as a sort option on both the 'Bike Model [name]...' pages and the 'All Mountain Bikes' page
<br>
The following **information based keyword** enquiries showed a lower volume of searches, but also low organic
competition:<br>
* what is a mountain bike
* what are hardtail mountain bikes
* what are full suspension mountain bikes <br>
Represented as: <h2>'s on the 'What is a Mountain Bike' page accessed via the dropdown option under the 'Buying Guides' menu <br>

* what size mountain bike do I need <br>
Represented as: a <h4> on the 'Mountain Bike Sizing Guide' page accessed via the dropdown option under the 'Buying Guides' menu <br>

**Long-tail keywords pertaining to information from external 3rd party organisations:**<br>
This long-tail keyword showed a high volume, with mid to high level of organic competition.  As this particular
scheme is a UK Government Initiative and is implemented by most mountain bike sellers, the high volume and high 
competition are deemed not have an impact on Summit Bike Co. as a business - but representation is essential in demonstrating that Summit Bike Co. both supports and offers this scheme to their customers.
* cycle to work scheme
Represented as an anchor tag (<a>) on the 'Cycle to Work Scheme' page accessed via the dropdown option under the 'About Us' menu <br>
